                  by its amazing modern technologies. [Mobile phone, internet]

                  With the help of [internet], we can see the whole world. It
                  helps us know the economy, education, culture, technology and
                  sports of the world. Using [internet], we can send messages,

                  But there is no unmixed blessing on the earth. [Internet] has
                  still some drawbacks in disguise. Using [internet] can cause
                  many diseases to the user. Terrorist are using it to spread

                  of the young generation. Our young generation are led to go
                  astray by this obscenity. <br />
                  it should be our morality to accept the good and give up the
                  bad. And the government should create public awareness.
                  However, [internet] is an indispensable part of our modern

                  warm enough to support life. Environmental pollution

                  For healthy living, the main elements of the environment such
                  as air, water and soil, should be free from pollution. But
                  when the balance of these elements is hampered, it is called
                  environmental pollution. <br />
                  This pollution is a great threat to our existence. They cause
                  various human diseases. These diseases may lead a man to
                  death. It changes the world's climate and increases
                  temperature. This reduces human capacity to work. It also
                  causes natural disasters like cyclones. This temperature will
                  melt polar ice-caps and sea levels will increase. As a result,
                  coastal areas will go under water.
                  <br />
                  Thus the world is getting unsuitable for living. So, to make
                  life healthy and comfortable, we should keep the environment
                  clean and pollution free. <br />

                  in Bangladesh. I like this journey very much. Now I will
                  describe such a [journey]. It was a historical place named
                  Paharpur, a remote village from Naogaon district. <br />
                  During the summer vacation, we arranged this [study tour] by
                  [bus]. We took enough food and fruit with us. Early in the
                  morning, we had started our journey. It was a sunny day. While
                  passing through, we were glad to see the beautiful scenery of
                  the rural areas. On both sides, we saw green fields of paddy,
                  jute, and plants. We were caught by the natural beauty. But
                  after reaching there, we were really overwhelmed by the beauty
                  of the relics of Buddha Vihar. It was built about seven
                  hundred years ago. It reminds us of the maxim, "seeing is
                  believing."
                  <br />
                  Without traveling, education remains incomplete and imperfect.
                  Traveling removes boredom and offers pleasure. So, we should
                  take traveling and tours.

                  establish hospital, clinic etc in the villages. I have also
                  planned to do some social work like repairing bridges, roads,
                  and other services. Thus, I want to serve the nation through
                  my profession.
                  <br />
                  Everyone should continue to work according to his future
                  [plan]. To reach my goal, I am also preparing well in all
                  subjects. After completing my [MBBS], I will start executing
                  my [plain].
                  <br />
                  Success in life depends much on the [plain] of life, and my

                  Man aims for his future. An aimless life is like a boat

                <strong>Answer: </strong>
                Ours is a developing country. We have no enough riches. So, (NP)
                is a very great national problem. It has a top negative effect
                on every person in our society and country. It baffles the
                normal development programme. It has on positive side. The
                nations who have avoided it have made more development.
                <br />
                (NP) waste the valuable time and properties on the other hand
                spend more to be normal. Many reasons are behind it. The
                unconsciousness of the people and the government is the main.
                Again some natural and human negative acts cause this type of
                problem. The (NP) is among them. At this the government and the
                general people are to suffer a lot.
                <br />
                We can not expect and ensure a better and comfortable life. We
                are to depend on others. So to ensure happy life, such acts must
                be checked. All the people of the country should come forward to
                stop and uproot it. But the government should take emergency and
                proper step to protect it.

                  <p className="">
                    <strong>Answer: </strong>There are various noble qualities
                    which separate a good man from a bad man. It is one of them.
                    It is a great virtue. The man who possesses this quality is
                    the luckiest person. To be (it) in one's behavior costs him
                    nothing. Rather it brings much benefit. It indicates that he
                    is a well- bred man and no one find any reason to hate him.
                    <br />
                    It implies obedience to a set of rules for an orderly life
                    in society and stands for a code of conduct, which conforms
                    to the norms of etiquette that weave a behavior pattern
                    which is becoming of a gentleman. Thus it will have to be
                    cultivated in one's character from an early age. Though it
                    does not call for any pecuniary expenditure, it earns a
                    great dividend. A man who is devoid of (it) catches trouble
                    at every step and makes a misery of his life.On the other
                    hand one who has added (it) to his conduct can shine in life
                    and is loved by every individual of society. He can get on
                    smoothly and easily through the thick and thin of life.
                    <br />
                    So, though (it) is a mental faculty and invincible its
                    effect is greatly felt. It is necessary in every walk of
                    life. Man is a social being. In society, he can not do
                    whatever he likes to do. He has to abide by some rules to
                    have peace in society. (It) is one of them. Without (it)
                    chaos will prevail everywhere. It is also key to success in
                    human life. If we make a list of successful persons we will
                    find their success mainly depend upon this great value.
                    Binding it, they not only made their life fruitful but also
                    helped in the advancement of civilization. So the value of
                    it is equally retain every sphere of our life. It is one of
                    the best virtues of mankind and absence of it makes a man
                    unhappy and forlorn. In fact it is more valuable than money.
                    One may have vast property but he is hated only for the
                    absence of it. So wealth is not the only means of happiness
                    in life. The ignorant only follow the other way. Without it,
                    peace and happiness in life is impossible. It is therefor
                    the most precious possession of a man.
                    <br />
                    (It) is seldom an inborn virtue. It should be acquired by
                    force of practice. The children should be taught (it) from
                    the very beginning of life. Without it, there can be no
                    progress, no peace, happiness and no success. In a word
                    those who have risen in their respective vocation have done
                    so simple by dint of it. Therefore we should possess this
                    invaluable virtue which cannot be reckoned in terms of
                    monetary value.

                <div className="">
                  The Anti-discrimination Student Movement was a big incident in
                  Bangladesh in July 2024. It started as the students were
                  unhappy about the government's quota system for jobs.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  In June 2024, the High Court announced a 30% quota for the
                  children of freedom fighters in government jobs. There were
                  already quotas for other groups, which meant only 44% of jobs
                  were left for general applicants. The students thought this
                  was unfair and wanted a change.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  This protest was not the first one. Similar protests took
                  place in 2013 and 2018. This time, the students took to the
                  streets again. They blocked roads and became very serious
                  about the protest. The protests grew stronger gradually. On
                  July 15, some armed people attacked the students, injuring
                  many. The protests became more violent, and many students were
                  hurt. The students then turned their protest against the
                  government. On August 3, they made one demand: the government
                  must resign.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Finally, on August 5, the Prime Minister stepped down.c The
                  students' unity and hard work helped bring down the government
                  and changed the future of Bangladesh.

                  contain a lot of mineral salts and vitamins. We can keep in
                  sound health by eating them in plenty. We can also earn much
                  foreign currency by exporting fruits. <br />
                  <br />
                  The fruits of Bangladesh are full of variety. They can help
                  our economy to develop if they are properly preserved. Fruits
                  can be helpful to build up our national health. We should try
                  to grow more fruits.

                  The Birds of Bangladesh
                </h2>
                <div className="">
                  <br />
                  Bangladesh is endowed with many natural gifts. Its climate,
                  soil, marshes, rivers, canals, bills, haors, green fields,
                  forests all have made it a suitable and ideal home for various
                  kinds of birds to live in. From dawn to dusk we see many kinds
                  of birds here and there. Their difference in colour, size and
                  nature fascinates us. <br />
                  <br />
                  The cuckoo, the doel, the bau-katha-kao, the shama, the moyna,
                  the koel are prominent singing birds of Bangladesh. The cuckoo
                  is the most popular of all singing birds. It appears at the
                  advent of the spring. The doel is our national bird.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Another familiar bird in our country is the crow. When it
                  crows at dawn, we know that the night is over. It is very
                  clever but its voice is harsh and it looks ugly. It steals
                  food. It is very unpopular. Very often sitting upon electric
                  wires or trees it empties its bowel upon passer-by. <br />
                  <br />
                  The dove, the pigeon, the heron, the partridge, the goose are
                  some common birds of Bangladesh. Their meat is tasty and
                  delicious. The sparrow is another common bird. <br />
                  <br />
                  The parrot and the myna are talking birds. They can imitate
                  the voice of man. So some people keep them as pets. <br />
                  <br />
                  The kite, the hawk and the vulture are the birds of prey. They
                  prey upon chickens and ducklings. The crane and the kingfisher
                  are found near watery places. They live on fish. The
                  woodpecker is a pretty bird with a strong bill. These birds
                  have keen eyes and sharp nails. <br />
                  <br />
                  The birds of our country are our valuable assets. In many
                  respects they are helpful to us. Many of them help in
                  spreading the seeds of trees in different places. Thus they
                  help in afforestation. Some of them eat up rubbish and many
                  harmful insects and worms. Others add to the beauty of Nature.
                  So we should not kill birds. We should plant more trees to
                  provide them with dwelling places.

                  Duties of a Student
                </h2>
               
                  Student life is the most useful and valuable period in a man's
                  life. This is the time when the seeds of future life are sown.
                  For this, it is called the sowing season in our life. During
                  this period a student has to do certain things to be
                  successful and happy in his future life.
                  <br />
                  The principal duty of a student is to study and acquire
                  knowledge on various things. He must study according to a
                  routine. He has to be attentive to his studies and teachers.
                  He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature,
                  history, etc.
                  <br />
                  A student should remember that character is the crown of a
                  man. So he has to cultivate good manners and other noble
                  virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty,
                  truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality
                  must be acquired during this time.
                  <br />
                  He should also render some services to his society and
                  country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make
                  the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In
                  population control, he can play an important role.
                  <br />
                  A student must obey and honour his parents. When they are
                  sick, helpless or old, he must serve them. He should also be
                  obedient to his teachers and other superiors.
                  <br />
                  A student must not waste his time and energy. So he must
                  possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise,
                  taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always
                  avoid evil company.
                  <br />
                  Besides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he
                  must not take part in active politics. It is because many
                  political parties and their unethical leaders use them only
                  for their selfish interest.
                  <br />
                  In case of national emergencies like floods, tornadoes,
                  storms, etc. he must not sit idle. He must extend his helping
                  hands during these times.
                  <br />
                  To reap the good and expected harvest of success in future, a
                  student must sow good seeds during his student life.
                  Otherwise, it will bring him utter failure, untold sorrows,
                  miseries and repentance.
