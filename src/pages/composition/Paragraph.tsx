                  things. This separates a good man from a bad man. A man who
                  posses this is loved by all. For example, a business man is
                  loved by his customers for this quality. A service holder is
                  loved by his colleagues and bosses. So, success in every
                  sphere of life largely depends on [TOPIC] . It's preferable to
                  wealth because one may have vast property but he is hated only
                  for the absence of it. So, to maintain peace in society, we
                  also must have [it] to be an ideal social being. Hence, all of
                  us should try our best to possess this valuable quality in our
                  lives for our own interest.

                  <strong>Answer: </strong>The word "[TOPIC]" connotes a

                  may be called a mental disease. In our society such person are

                  it is really horrible and shocking. In some cases, people are
                  found to be murdered and commit suicide. So, to maintain peace

                  gift of science. It gives us knowledge, education, and
                  recreation. Numerous programs are telecast on it. My favorite
                  TV program, film, or book is Hamlet, by Shakespeare, which I
                  have enjoyed. In it, Hamlet, Prince of Scotland, is the tragic
                  hero whose father is murdered by his uncle. His uncle also
                  married his mother. For this reason, he tried to take revenge
                  on his uncle, but he hesitated again and again. Ultimately, he
                  succeeded. Here, the theme of hesitation is a great lesson for
                  us. Thus, the book, film, program, or TV serial gives us
                  entertainment as well as instruction. It also refreshes our
                  mind. I think if anyone watches or reads this program, serial,
                  film, or book, they need not read or watch anything else to
                  get a true picture of the human mind. I read or watched the
                  program or book eagerly. The program or book enticed me very
                  much.

            <p className="text-start">
              <strong>Answer: </strong> Road accident is a pressing issue in
              Bangladesh, posing a great threat to public safety and aggravating
              its transportation system. Despite efforts to improve road
              conditions and enforce traffic regulations, the densely populated
              streets and highways remain prone to accidents. Factors such as
              reckless driving, overloading of vehicles, inadequate road
              maintenance, contribute to the alarming frequency of accidents.
              The consequences of these accidents are dire, causing not only
              loss of lives but also inflicting serious injuries and property
              damage. necessary measures are needed to solve this crisis,
              including enforcement of traffic laws, investment in road
              infrastructure, public awareness. Only by these steps, we can hope
              to reduce road accidents and making its streets safer for all.

            <h3 className="text-center py-3">Price Hike</h3>
            <p className="text-start">
              <strong>Answer: </strong> Price hikes have become a great concern
              in Bangladesh. Inflation, supply chain disruptions, fluctuating
              global commodity prices, and domestic production challenges are
              the causes of price hikes. The impact of price increases is felt
              everywhere. Vulnerable populations often bear the brunt of these
              hikes, as their purchasing power erodes. The government's efforts
              to control and mitigate these price hikes are crucial in
              alleviating the burden on the populace. Long-term strategies are
              essential to check the bad effects of price hikes and ensuring
              prosperous future for Bangladesh.
