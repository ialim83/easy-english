        1. An honest wood cutter.
        <br />
        One there lived a poor wood-cutter. But he was very honest. Every day he
        went out to cut wood in the jungle. He earned his livelihood by selling
        wood in the market. One day while he was cutting wood beside a river,
        suddenly his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into deep water. The
        axe was the only means of his livelihood. He did not know how to swim
        and began to weep bitterly. Suddenly a fairy appeared before him. His
        bitter cry drew the attention of the fairy. “Why do you weep, good
        man?’’ The the woodcutter told her everything. Hearing this, the fairy
        took pity on him. The fairy dived into the water and brought a golden
        axe. “Is this your axe?” “No,” replied the wood-cutter. Then she again
        dived into the water and brought a silver axe. This time also the
        wood-cutter said that it was not his axe. So she dived for the third
        time and brought an iron axe of the wood-cutter. The wood-cutter was
        very glad to get his axe. The fairy became very pleased at his honesty.
        She gave him the two other axes as reward. Moral: Honesty is the best
        policy

        2. A thirsty Crow
        <br />
        It was a summer day and a crow became very thirsty. It went here and
        there in search of drinking water but in vain. The crow did not lose
        hope to get water. He found a jar a little distance away. He flew to the
        jar. He found that the jar had only a little water at the bottom. The
        crow tried to get at the water with his beak but he failed. He
        discovered that the water was too low for him to get. All of a sudden,
        he saw some stones lying near the jar. He picked up the stones one by
        one and dropped them into a jar. As a result, the water in the jar rose
        up gradually and at last the crow was able to drink. Thus the crow tried
        again and again and at last succeeded.

        the sticks. This time they all broke their sticks easily. Then the old

        Once there lived a very clever fox in a jungle. One day, when the fox
        was walking through the jungle, he fell into a trap but he lost his

        ashamed. But the fox was very cunning. He thought and finally hit upon a
        plan. He invited all other foxes of the jungle in a meeting. When all
        other foxes attended the meeting, He said to them, “I’ve invited you to
        tell about a a very important discovery of mine. There is no use of the
        tail in our life. Rather it is an extra burden for us. Without a tail I
        feel very light/ comfortable.. Now I can run faster than before. So, you
        all should cut off your tails.” They said, “You’re right. We’ll cut off
        our tails without wasting time.” At that moment one old wise fox stood
        up and said in anger. “Don’t follow this rogue. He has lost his tail in
        a trap. Now, He looks strange. He wants to look like him.” Hearing this
        all the foxes became very angry with cunning fox. He fled away in fear
        and saved his life.

        There lived a shepherd boy in a certain village. He used to graze sheep
        near a forest. But the boy had a bad habit. He used to tell a lie on the
        slightest excuse. He also used to make fun by telling lies. One day He
        wanted to have fun with the villagers. The villagers knew him well. They
        were simple and very helpful. They used to help others in times of
        danger. One day, the shepherd boy began to shout. “Wolf! Help!” The
        villagers heard his cry and ran to help him. But when they came near
        him, they found no wolf and the boy laughed at them. For this reason,
        the villagers became very angry. They did not punish him but warned him
        not to do it again. A few days later, the shepherd boy again had the
        same fun. The villagers came again to help him but found no wolf there.
        They felt very much bored. They rebuked him but the boy did not pay heed
        to them and kept laughing. At the time of their departure, they said,
        “If you cry out for help again, we will not come because you are a
        liar.” One day at afternoon, while the boy was grazing the sheep in the
        field, suddenly he saw that a wolf really fell upon his sheep and began
        to kill them. The boy became very afraid and shouted, “Wolf! Wolf! Help!
        Help! A wolf is in my sheep! Come and help me!” The villagers heard him
        but Nobody came to help him. The wolf not only feasted on the sheep but
        also killed the shepherd. Afterwards, when his dead body was found, the
        villagers kept saying for a time being, “ If he didn’t tell lies, we
        would respond to his cry and perhaps he might avoid the danger. ’’So, we
        should always speak the truth and it is very unwise to make fun by
        telling lies. <br />
        Moral: Falsehood brings destruction. <br />

        7. Lion and a Mouse <br />
        Once upon a time there would live a lion and a mouse in a jungle. One
        day the lion was sleeping in its cave. The mouse was afraid of the lion
        but unfortunately the mouse was to walk over the lion’s face without
        noticing it. At this the lion woke up and saw the mouse just crossing
        his face. He caught hold of it and asked; “now I will kill you for your
        offence of disturbing me in my sleep”. At this the mouse was about to
        lose its senses. It began to tremble in fear and begged for its life.
        Then it urged the lion to spare its life for this time. The mouse also
        promised “I’ll help you in case of your need.” To its promise the lion
        thought, “How a little mouse will help me, it is really funny.” After a
        few days the lion got captured in a net. The lion tried to escape the
        net but it could not do so. At that time the little mouse was going
        along that way and heard the groaning of the lion. It rushed to help the
        lion in gratitude. The mouse freed the lion from the net by cutting it
        through. The lion also showed his gratefulness to the mouse and said,
        “Now I realize that all the living creatures in the universe are
        important, nothing is negligible.” Being free, the the lion said, “You
        are small in size but worthy. You have saved my life and many thanks to
        you.” In fact the strong or mighty someone is also dependent on the weak
        one. From then the lion was kind hearted to the tiny creature. Till then
        the mouse and the lion became good friends. <br />

        sleep, thinking that in a few seconds he may overtake the tortoise. But

        doesn’t eat a dead animal. So he lay down on the on the grass like a
        dead man. The bear came to the lying friend and smelt his body.When he
        guessed that the bear was just beside him, he stopped breathing The bear
        thought that he was dead and went away slowly. The first friend got down
        from the tree. He came to the second friend and said to his friend,
        “What did the bear whisper to your ear?” The bear advised me not to
        trust a friend who leaves his friend at the time of danger. At this, The
        false friend felt embarrassed and left the place. So we should be
        careful in choosing friend and bear in mind that a friend in need is a
        friend indeed.

        11. Dividing of the bread between two cats
        <br />
        Once there lived two cats in a house. One day they stole a piece of
        bread from their neighboring house. But the problem arose how to divide
        it because each of the cats wanted the larger part. When they failed to
        reach my conclusion, they went to a monkey who is considered to be the
        wisest of all the animals. They requested the money to divide the bread
        equally. The monkey brought a pair of scales. He torn out the bread into
        two pieces and put them on the scales. He told the cats that one piece
        was clearly heavier than the other. So, he bit off a part of the bigger
        piece. As a result the other piece became heavier. Then the monkey took
        a part of the bigger piece and put it on the scales. The monkey
        continued doing the same thing again and again until there remained only
        one piece of bread. After that, the cats told the monkey to return the
        remaining piece to them. They said that they themselves would divide the
        bread equally. But the monkey said that he toiled much to divide the
        bread equally. So he wanted it as his fee. Saying so, the monkey ate up
        that piece also. The cat left the place in a very sad mood but the
        incident made them wise also.
